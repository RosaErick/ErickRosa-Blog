I'm Erick, I'm 26, I graduated from Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro with a Bachelor of History, but have gained a massive interest in web development and technologies. I'm passionate about building things with code. I've always been curious about coding but after starting the Responsive Web Design curriculum from freeCodeCamp I was hooked.

Since being introduced to coding I have started reading articles, listening to podcasts, taking online courses and creating a portfolio of projects. I sincerely think that I have discovered my passion in life.
